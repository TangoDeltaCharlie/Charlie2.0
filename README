Set up Xbox 360 controller mapping by running the standalone Xbox controller function. 
This will print each button name when pressed, so play around until hitting A prints 'A Pressed' and so on.
Ive commented out the original mappings that may work with WINDOWS and added Mac mappings below them, so it might be as easy as swithing the comments

Once the Xbox controller is set up, run main.py. This will open a GUI asking to start the program or quit.
Pressing 'A' or 'B' on the keyboard or on the Xbox controller will start the system. 
The GUI will now show the webcame and sensor data.

Main.py needs to be changed to connect to the Pi camera rather than the webcam
ReceiveData.py needs to be changed to connect to the Pi and receive data rather than reading the test file I created.


I still have a fair amount of work to do with the GUI popups for temperature control and just over all finalzing code and polishing stuff for efficiency
